# CORONA VIRUS PROJECT REPOSITORY

# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical 
conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.

In general, reinfection means a person was infected (got sick) once, recovered, and then later became infected again. Based on what we know
from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected. Although the immune correlates of protection are not fully understood, evidence indicates 
that antibody development following infection likely confers some degree of immunity from subsequent infection for at least 6 months.

This repository contains the files bearing the analysis of confirmed negative, positive predicted cases, death cases, population size, life expectancy at birth
and pre-existing conditioned affected cases in the USA. The dataset was taken from CDC of USA and contains the states and regions in states recorded COVID-19 cases
